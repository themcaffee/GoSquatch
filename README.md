# GoSquatch

GoSquatch is a fast Github Action that converts markdown into a static HTML site. This is useful for personal blogs and project documentation to keep pages in standard markdown while hosting them through Github Pages (or other providers). GoSquatch uses [native golang templating](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) and [gomarkdown/markdown](https://github.com/gomarkdown/markdown) to handle markdown parsing. It includes a live building server so you can easily preview your site locally before publishing it. See the [performance documentation](https://mitchmcaffee.com/GoSquatch/performance) for details on execution speed.
