# Github Action

GoSquatch provides a Github Action on the Marketplace. You can check it out [here!](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gosquatch)

## Inputs

#### `srcDir`

The source directory to pull the markdown and templates from. Default `"src"`.

## Configuration

GoSquatch is configured with a `.squatch` in the folder `srcDir`. This file is not required and the action will run just fine without it. However,
if you need additional configuration options then it is available.

## Example Usage

```

  push:
    branches:
      - main

  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "deploy"
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
